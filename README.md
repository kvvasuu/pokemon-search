# Simple Pokémon Search App.

## General info

It was a certification project from freeCodeCamp.org - **"Build a Pokémon Search App"**...
But I did much more than was required to pass and then remake it using Vue.

In the application, we enter the name or ID of the Pokémon. After pressing the "search" button, the application sends a request to the API. If it finds the right Pokemon, it is displayed on the website:

- Name, ID
- Weight, Height
- Appearance
- Types

You can play sound of Pokémon by clicking on sprite.

A table with statistics is displayed below.

If it doesn't find a Pokémon, it displays the message "Pokémon not found"

## Technologies:

- Vue
- Font Awesome
- PokéAPI- https://pokeapi.co/

## Setup
